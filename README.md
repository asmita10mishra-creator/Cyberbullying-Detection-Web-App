📌 Overview This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying in online text data using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The goal is to build a system that can classify whether a given text (e.g., a tweet, comment, or message) contains cyberbullying content or not.

Features Preprocessing of raw social media text data. Text vectorization using TF-IDF. Model training with various algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes). Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization.
⚙️ Technologies Used Python Pandas, NumPy scikit-learn NLTK / spaCy Matplotlib / Seaborn

📊 Results Accuracy achieved: ~90% (may vary by model and dataset) Best model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Insights: SVM and Logistic Regression outperformed Naive Bayes in most scenarios.

📌 Future Work Integrate deep learning models like LSTM or BERT. Real-time detection using a web or mobile app. Expand dataset to include multilingual content.
